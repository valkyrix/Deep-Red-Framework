I would like to take this opportunity to thank my project supervisor, Xavier Bellekens, who introduced me to the topic of Machine Learning and offered guidance from the beginning through to the completion of this project. Without whom this project would not have been possible. I would also like to thank the module leader, Colin McLean, who has given me continuous advice throughout my years of study at Abertay University.
