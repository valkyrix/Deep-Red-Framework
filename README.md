# Deep-Red-Framework
## Implementing Deep Learning techniques to construct a Red Teaming solution
### Tasks

* Do background research on Machine Learning models and finalise design
* Find or create a legal dataset
* Automate the sanitization and collation of data (CVE's etc)
* Standardize data from network reports in order to input into RNN
* Create overall outlining framework with ML aspects.
* Train the models.
