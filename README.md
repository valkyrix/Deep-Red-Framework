# Deep-Red-Framework
## Implementing Deep Learning techniques to construct a Red Teaming solution
### Tasks

<<<<<<< HEAD
* Do background research on Machine Learning models and finalise design
* Find or create a legal dataset
* Automate the sanitization and collation of data (CVE's etc)
* Standardize data from network reports in order to input into RNN
* Create overall outlining framework with ML aspects.
* Train the models.
* Test the models.
* Metasploit cli integration. Find a way to script meterpreter into python scripts.
* Program report creation section
* Make the software portable (currently everything is being setup in a non-portable environment). This involves nessus, metasploit, theano, python and linux environments to be taken into account.
* Project documentation
