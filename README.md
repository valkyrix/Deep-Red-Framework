# Deep-Red-Framework

## Implementing Deep Learning techniques to construct a Red Teaming solution

### Tasks

Items in __bold__ are currently being worked on.
Items ~~ruled~~ are completed.

* ~~Do background research on Machine Learning models and finalise design~~
* Find or create a legal dataset (Shodan api?). Rapid7 had a project called Sonar which spawned scans.io (very interesting).
* ~~Automate the sanitization and collation of data (CVE's etc)~~
* __Standardize data from network reports in order to input into RNN.__
* __Create overall outlining framework.__
* __Random Forest and RNN integration. Possibly using Keras ontop of Theano.__
* Train the models.
* Test the models.
* ~~Metasploit cli integration. Find a way to script meterpreter into python scripts.~~ note: msgrpc module needs to be running in order to script metasploit (needs to be executed manually on windows systems)
* Automate metasploit exploit checker based off of random forest results.
* Technical report creation section
* Make the software portable (currently everything is being setup in a non-portable environment). This involves nessus, metasploit, postgresql, theano/anaconda and linux environments to be taken into account.
* The possibility of using virtual environments such as docker to run all tools required.
* Project documentation (Thesis/Journal).

__current problem: figuring out what to make the RNN calculate, what features and labels it should have.__
#### Please check back soon for more details.
